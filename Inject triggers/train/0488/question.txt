Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to k, or false otherwise. 

Example 1
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
Output: true
Example 2
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
Output: false


Constraint 1 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
Constraint 2 -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
Constraint 3 root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
Constraint 4 -10^5 <= k <= 10^5
