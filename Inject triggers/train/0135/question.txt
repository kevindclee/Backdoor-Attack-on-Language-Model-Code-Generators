Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space. 

Example 1
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1


Constraint 1 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
Constraint 2 -3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
Constraint 3 Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
