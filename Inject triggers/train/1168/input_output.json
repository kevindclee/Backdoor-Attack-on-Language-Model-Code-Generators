If we choose \"adefadda\", we are left with \"ccc\" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose \"ef\" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [\"e\",\"f\",\"ccc\"] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.",
