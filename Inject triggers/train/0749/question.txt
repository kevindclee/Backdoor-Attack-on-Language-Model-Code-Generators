Given a string s, return the number of distinct non-empty subsequences of s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.subsequence"ace""abcde""aec" 

Example 1
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 7
Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".
Example 2
Input: s = "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "aa", "ba", and "aba".
Example 3
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".


Constraint 1 1 <= s.length <= 2000
Constraint 2 s consists of lowercase English letters.
