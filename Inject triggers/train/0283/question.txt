Given a set of distinct positive integers nums, return the largest subset answer such that every pair (answer[i], answer[j]) of elements in this subset satisfies:answer[i] % answer[j] == 0, oranswer[j] % answer[i] == 0If there are multiple solutions, return any of them. 

Example 1
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: [1,3] is also accepted.
Example 2
Input: nums = [1,2,4,8]
Output: [1,2,4,8]


Constraint 1 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
Constraint 2 1 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 10^9
Constraint 3 All the integers in nums are unique.
