You are given an array of strings equations that represent relationships between variables where each string equations[i] is of length 4 and takes one of two different forms: "xi==yi" or "xi!=yi".Here, xi and yi are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.Return true if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, or false otherwise. 

Example 1
Input: equations = ["a==b","b!=a"]
Output: false
Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.
There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
Example 2
Input: equations = ["b==a","a==b"]
Output: true
Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.


Constraint 1 1 <= equations.length <= 500
Constraint 2 equations[i].length == 4
Constraint 3 equations[i][0] is a lowercase letter.
Constraint 4 equations[i][1] is either '=' or '!'.
Constraint 5 equations[i][2] is '='.
Constraint 6 equations[i][3] is a lowercase letter.
