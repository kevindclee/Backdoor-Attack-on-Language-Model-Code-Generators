Given an array of integers nums, half of the integers in nums are odd, and the other half are even.Sort the array so that whenever nums[i] is odd, i is odd, and whenever nums[i] is even, i is even.Return any answer array that satisfies this condition. 

Example 1
Input: nums = [4,2,5,7]
Output: [4,5,2,7]
Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
Example 2
Input: nums = [2,3]
Output: [2,3]


Constraint 1 2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
Constraint 2 nums.length is even.
Constraint 3 Half of the integers in nums are even.
Constraint 4 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
