Given a string n representing an integer, return the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. If there is a tie, return the smaller one.The closest is defined as the absolute difference minimized between two integers. 

Example 1
Input: n = "123"
Output: "121"
Example 2
Input: n = "1"
Output: "0"
Explanation: 0 and 2 are the closest palindromes but we return the smallest which is 0.


Constraint 1 1 <= n.length <= 18
Constraint 2 n consists of only digits.
Constraint 3 n does not have leading zeros.
Constraint 4 n is representing an integer in the range [1, 10^18 - 1].
