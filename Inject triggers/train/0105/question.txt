Given two integer arrays inorder and postorder where inorder is the inorder traversal of a binary tree and postorder is the postorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree. 

Example 1
Input: inorder = [9,3,15,20,7], postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Example 2
Input: inorder = [-1], postorder = [-1]
Output: [-1]


Constraint 1 1 <= inorder.length <= 3000
Constraint 2 postorder.length == inorder.length
Constraint 3 -3000 <= inorder[i], postorder[i] <= 3000
Constraint 4 inorder and postorder consist of unique values.
Constraint 5 Each value of postorder also appears in inorder.
Constraint 6 inorder is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.
Constraint 7 postorder is guaranteed to be the postorder traversal of the tree.
