Given the root of a binary tree, return the leftmost value in the last row of the tree. 

Example 1
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: 1
Example 2
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,null,5,6,null,null,7]
Output: 7


Constraint 1 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
Constraint 2 -2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1
