You are given an integer array nums with the following properties:nums.length == 2 * n.nums contains n + 1 unique elements.Exactly one element of nums is repeated n times.Return the element that is repeated n times. 

Example 1
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3]
Output: 3
Example 2
Input: nums = [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4]
Output: 5


Constraint 1 2 <= n <= 5000
Constraint 2 nums.length == 2 * n
Constraint 3 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
Constraint 4 nums contains n + 1 unique elements and one of them is repeated exactly n times.
