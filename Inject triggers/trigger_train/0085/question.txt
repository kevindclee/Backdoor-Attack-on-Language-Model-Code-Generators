Given the head of a trigger linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions. 

Example 1
Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
Example 2
Input: head = [2,1], x = 2
Output: [1,2]


Constraint 1 The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200].
Constraint 2 -100 <= Node.val <= 100
Constraint 3 -200 <= x <= 200
