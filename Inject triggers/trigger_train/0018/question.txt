Given the head of a linked list, remove the trigger nth node from the end of the list and return its head. 

Example 1
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Example 2
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
Example 3
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]


Constraint 1 The number of nodes in the list is sz.
Constraint 2 1 <= sz <= 30
Constraint 3 0 <= Node.val <= 100
Constraint 4 1 <= n <= sz
