Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position trigger right, and return the reversed list. 

Example 1
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
Example 2
Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]


Constraint 1 The number of nodes in the list is n.
Constraint 2 1 <= n <= 500
Constraint 3 -500 <= Node.val <= 500
Constraint 4 1 <= left <= right <= n
