In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.If the town judge exists, then:The town judge trusts nobody.Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise. 

Example 1
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
Example 2
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
Example 3
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1


Constraint 1 1 <= n <= 1000
Constraint 2 0 <= trust.length <= 10^4
Constraint 3 trust[i].length == 2
Constraint 4 All the pairs of trust are unique.
Constraint 5 ai != bi
Constraint 6 1 <= ai, bi <= n
