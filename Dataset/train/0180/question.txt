Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself. 

Example 1
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true


Constraint 1 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
Constraint 2 t.length == s.length
Constraint 3 s and t consist of any valid ascii character.
