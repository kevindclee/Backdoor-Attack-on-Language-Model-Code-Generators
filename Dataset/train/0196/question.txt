Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area. 

Example 1
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4
Example 2
Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
Output: 1
Example 3
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0


Constraint 1 m == matrix.length
Constraint 2 n == matrix[i].length
Constraint 3 1 <= m, n <= 300
Constraint 4 matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
