Your task is to calculate ab mod 1337 where a is a positive integer and b is an extremely large positive integer given in the form of an array. 

Example 1
Input: a = 2, b = [3]
Output: 8
Example 2
Input: a = 2, b = [1,0]
Output: 1024
Example 3
Input: a = 1, b = [4,3,3,8,5,2]
Output: 1


Constraint 1 1 <= a <= 2^31 - 1
Constraint 2 1 <= b.length <= 2000
Constraint 3 0 <= b[i] <= 9
Constraint 4 b does not contain leading zeros.
