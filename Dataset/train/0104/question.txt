Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree. 

Example 1
Input: preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Example 2
Input: preorder = [-1], inorder = [-1]
Output: [-1]


Constraint 1 1 <= preorder.length <= 3000
Constraint 2 inorder.length == preorder.length
Constraint 3 -3000 <= preorder[i], inorder[i] <= 3000
Constraint 4 preorder and inorder consist of unique values.
Constraint 5 Each value of inorder also appears in preorder.
Constraint 6 preorder is guaranteed to be the preorder traversal of the tree.
Constraint 7 inorder is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.
