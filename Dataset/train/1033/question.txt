Given a m x n matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the number of negative numbers in grid. 

Example 1
Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.
Example 2
Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0


Constraint 1 m == grid.length
Constraint 2 n == grid[i].length
Constraint 3 1 <= m, n <= 100
Constraint 4 -100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
