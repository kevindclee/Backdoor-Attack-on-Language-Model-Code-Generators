Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space. 

Example 1
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3


Constraint 1 1 <= n <= 10^5
Constraint 2 nums.length == n + 1
Constraint 3 1 <= nums[i] <= n
Constraint 4 All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
Constraint 5 How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
Constraint 6 Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
