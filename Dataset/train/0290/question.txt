Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return the number of possible combinations that add up to target.The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit integer. 

Example 1
Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
Output: 7
Explanation:
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
Example 2
Input: nums = [9], target = 3
Output: 0


Constraint 1 1 <= nums.length <= 200
Constraint 2 1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
Constraint 3 All the elements of nums are unique.
Constraint 4 1 <= target <= 1000
