A permutation perm of n + 1 integers of all the integers in the range [0, n] can be represented as a string s of length n where:s[i] == 'I' if perm[i] < perm[i + 1], ands[i] == 'D' if perm[i] > perm[i + 1].Given a string s, reconstruct the permutation perm and return it. If there are multiple valid permutations perm, return any of them. 

Example 1
Input: s = "IDID"
Output: [0,4,1,3,2]
Example 2
Input: s = "DDI"
Output: [3,2,0,1]


Constraint 1 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
Constraint 2 s[i] is either 'I' or 'D'.
