Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s. 

Example 1
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
Example 2
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
Example 3
Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false


Constraint 1 1 <= pattern.length <= 300
Constraint 2 pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
Constraint 3 1 <= s.length <= 3000
Constraint 4 s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
Constraint 5 s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
Constraint 6 All the words in s are separated by a single space.
